## 🔗 **What Are Backlinks? (Simple Explanation)**

**Backlinks = Other websites linking to your website**

### **Think of it like this:**
- If lots of reputable websites link to you = Google thinks you're trustworthy
- More quality backlinks = Higher Google rankings
- It's like getting recommendations - the more people recommend you, the more trusted you become

### **Example:**
- A local news site writes about your calculator and links to your site = 1 backlink
- An installer puts "Get quotes from our partners" and links to you = 1 backlink
- A directory lists your business with a link = 1 backlink

### **Important:**
- Quality matters more than quantity
- 10 good backlinks > 100 spammy ones
- Natural links are best (don't buy links!)

### **How to Get Backlinks:**

**Easy Ways:**
1. **Partner with Installers** (BEST OPTION)
   - Ask installers to link to you
   - "Get quotes from our partners" (links to you)
   - "Compare quotes here" (links to you)
   - This is the easiest and most effective!

2. **List on Directories**
   - Yell.com
   - Thomson Local
   - FreeIndex
   - List as "Solar Energy Consultant"

3. **Create Valuable Content**
   - Write guides people want to link to
   - Your comparison guide is perfect for this!
   - People will naturally link to helpful resources

**Don't Worry About This Yet:**
- Focus on getting your site indexed first
- Then work on backlinks gradually
- Quality over quantity!
