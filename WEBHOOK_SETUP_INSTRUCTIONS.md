- ‚úÖ **Conflict resolution included** (handles Git conflicts automatically)

   git push origin main
   ```

### 2. Check if It Worked

1. **Check GitHub:** Go to your repository ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Webhooks

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Issue 1: "Unauthorized: Missing signature"
**Solution:** Make sure the secret token in GitHub matches exactly: `5BxmyiA1eqmxoRUXg0CNguolUZxAelvo`

#### Issue 2: "Repository path not found"
**Solution:** The repository should be cloned to `/home/sites/34b/b/b9ed38cdb2/public_html`

#### Issue 3: Webhook shows red X in GitHub
**Solution:** 
1. Click on the failed delivery to see the error message
2. Check if your website's `webhook-deploy.php` file is accessible
3. Verify the webhook URL is correct: `https://solar-panels-oldham.co.uk/webhook-deploy.php`

## üéâ Success!

Once everything is working, your workflow will be:

1. **Edit code** on your laptop
2. **Commit and push** to GitHub
3. **Automatic deployment** happens within seconds
4. **Your website is updated** automatically!

## üìù Additional Notes

- The webhook only triggers for pushes to the `main` branch
- You can still use the manual deploy button in 20i if needed
- The system is secure - only authenticated requests from GitHub will trigger deployments
- All deployment activity is logged for your reference

## üîí Security Features

- **Signature verification:** Only GitHub can trigger deployments
- **Branch checking:** Only main branch pushes trigger deployment
- **Detailed logging:** All activity is recorded
- **Error handling:** Failed deployments are logged and reported
