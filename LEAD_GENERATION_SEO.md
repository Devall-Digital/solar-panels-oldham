---

## 🎯 **YOUR BUSINESS MODEL**

- Connect homeowners with solar installers
- Earn commission from installers
- Free calculator + quote requests

**What You're NOT:**
- Not an installer yourself
- Not providing installation services
- Not a physical business location

---

- ✅ Added disclosure about commission model
- ✅ Changed language from "we install" to "we connect you with installers"

---

## 🚀 **SEO STRATEGY FOR LEAD GEN**

### **1. Focus on Different Keywords**

**Instead of:**
- ❌ "solar panel installer Oldham" (you're not an installer)
- ❌ "solar panel installation Oldham" (you don't install)

**Target These Instead:**
- ✅ "solar panel quotes Oldham"
- ✅ "compare solar panel prices Oldham"
- ✅ "solar panel calculator Oldham"
- ✅ "solar panel quotes Greater Manchester"
- ✅ "best solar panel deals Oldham"
- ✅ "solar panel quote comparison"
- ✅ "free solar panel quotes"
- ✅ "solar panel cost calculator"

**Why:** These keywords match what you actually do!

### **2. Google Business Profile Strategy**

**⚠️ ACTION REQUIRED - DO THIS LATER:**

**The Challenge:**
- Google Business Profile is for businesses with a physical location
- You're a lead gen service (may not qualify the same way)

**Your Options:**

#### **Option A: Set Up as Service Area Business** (RECOMMENDED)
1. Go to: https://business.google.com
2. Choose "Service area business" (not physical location)
3. Don't show your address (use service areas only)
4. Service areas: Oldham, Rochdale, Manchester, Ashton-under-Lyne, Bury, Bolton
5. Category: "Solar Energy Consultant" or "Business Consultant"
6. Description: "Free solar panel quote comparison service connecting homeowners with qualified installers"
7. Website: https://solar-panels-oldham.co.uk
8. Add photos (logo, calculator screenshots, etc.)

**What to Include:**
- Business name: "Solar Panels Oldham"
- Service areas: All Greater Manchester areas you serve
- Description: Mention free calculator and quote comparison
- Photos: Add relevant images
- Hours: Set reasonable business hours

**Pros:** Can still get listed, may appear in local searches
**Cons:** May not rank as well as actual installers, but still valuable

**Note:** You mentioned you'll do this later - that's fine! This is optional for lead gen businesses. Focus on organic SEO first, then add Google Business Profile when you're ready.

#### **Option B: Skip Google Business Profile**
- Focus on organic SEO instead
- Target comparison/quote keywords
- Build authority through content

**Recommendation:** Try Option A when you're ready, but don't rely on it as your main strategy. Organic SEO is more important for lead gen.

### **3. Content Strategy (Critical for Lead Gen)**

**You Need to Position Yourself As:**
- Helpful comparison tool
- Expert advisor (not installer)
- Trusted source for quotes

**Content Ideas:**

#### **A. Comparison/Guide Content**
- "How to Compare Solar Panel Quotes in Oldham"
- "What to Look for in a Solar Panel Installer"
- "Solar Panel Costs in Greater Manchester: Complete Guide"
- "Questions to Ask Solar Panel Installers"

#### **B. Calculator/Tool Content**
- "Free Solar Panel Calculator for Oldham"
- "Calculate Your Solar Panel Savings"
- "ROI Calculator for Solar Panels"

#### **C. Area-Specific Pages**
- "Solar Panel Quotes Oldham"
- "Solar Panel Quotes Rochdale"
- "Solar Panel Quotes Manchester"

**Each Page Should:**
- Explain you're a comparison service
- Provide value (calculator, guides, tips)
- Have clear CTA to get quotes
- Be transparent about your model

---

### **4. Schema Markup (Updated)**

**What I Changed:**
- ✅ Changed from "LocalBusiness" to "Organization"
- ✅ Removed address/phone (you don't have one)
- ✅ Focused on service type: "Quote Comparison"

**This is Correct Now!**

---

### **5. Legal/Compliance**

**You MUST Disclose:**
- That you're a lead generation service
- That you may receive commission
- That installers pay you

**Where to Add:**
- Footer (already added ✅)
- About page (create one)
- Terms of service page
- Privacy policy page

**Why:** 
- Legal requirement (UK consumer law)
- Builds trust
- Google likes transparency

---

## 📝 **CONTENT STRATEGY**

## 🔗 **LINK BUILDING STRATEGY (What Are Backlinks?)**

### **What Are Backlinks? (Simple Explanation)**

**Backlinks = Other websites linking to your website**

Think of it like this:
- If lots of reputable websites link to you = Google thinks you're trustworthy
- More quality backlinks = Higher Google rankings
- It's like getting recommendations - the more people recommend you, the more trusted you become

**Example:**
- A local news site writes about your calculator and links to your site = 1 backlink
- An installer puts "Get quotes from our partners" and links to you = 1 backlink
- A directory lists your business with a link = 1 backlink

**Important:** Quality matters more than quantity. 10 good backlinks > 100 spammy ones.

---

### **What Works for Lead Gen:**

#### **Easy Wins:**
1. **Comparison Site Directories**
   - List on comparison site directories
   - "Quote comparison" directories

2. **Local Business Directories**
   - List as "Solar Energy Consultant"
   - Or "Business Services"
   - Examples: Yell.com, Thomson Local, FreeIndex

3. **Industry Directories**
   - Renewable energy directories
   - Home improvement directories

4. **Partner Links** (BEST OPTION)
   - Get installers to link to you
   - "Get quotes from our partners"
   - "Compare quotes here" (links to you)
   - This is the easiest and most effective!

#### **Content-Based Links:**
1. **Create Valuable Guides**
   - "Complete Guide to Solar Panels in Oldham"
   - "Solar Panel Cost Calculator Guide"
   - Get linked to as a resource

2. **Local News/Media**
   - Pitch story: "New Free Solar Calculator Launches"
   - Get coverage = links
